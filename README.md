# QR-Component
This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 
Frontend Mentor challenges helps me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My process
Researching about Flexbox and its properties: I got familiarize with some of them like display, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, flex-wrap, and others. Understood how they affect the layout and positioning of flex items within a flex container.
After grasping the basic concepts, i started coding in VSCode and created an HTML file along with a CSS file. I started by implementing a simple Flexbox layout, applying the necessary Flexbox properties to the appropriate HTML elements.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
